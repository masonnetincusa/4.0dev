  <center>The old MASONNET logo (2022-2025) is now out-of-date and use of it has been discontinued on masonnet.org as of late 2025/early 2026. A new logo is coming that will be used across all MASONNET websites and services from now on. The old logo may still show up in some places or old websites that we can't control.</center>
  <br>
  <center>A lot of you missed out on web 3.0 that just came out. Don't worry. We are making a lot of changes including getting an all-new logo that is 100% ours with fonts we are allowed to use, potentially a new name, and more like advanced web technologies!</center>
